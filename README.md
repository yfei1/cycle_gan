This is a workspace dedicated to the final project of CS2470 - Deep Learning

Please follow the generator code in cycleGAN.py to implement any further code blocks. 

Preprocessor should output a numpy ndarray of uniform size: (NUM_IMAGES, IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_DEPTH)

Any undone modifications should be marked with # TODO tag. Remove the # TODO tag if the code can be compiled and runned successfully
